        <p>So this is the real deal if you want to be cool.</p>
<p>I abandoned the stupid idea of creating a browser from scratch that can barely run GitHub or even play some videos on YouTube and decided to focus on good stuff. That&rsquo;s when I decided to learn more about audio processing with Juce.</p>
<p>My friend Julia Kaffka sent me a link about some Python library from Spotify that was created for musicians or producers. Yeah, if I say Python sucks, it is a lie. It pays my bills for quite a time now and I have no complaints about it.</p>
<p>But let us be honest and straightforward: it is not the best language when you&rsquo;re dealing with real time signal processing. That may demand more processing that is needed if you&rsquo;re working with C++ or something like that.</p>
<p>For my surprise, a quick look at this Spotishit library repo on GitHub: it is a cool disguise for C++ Juce Framework with some ports for Python language. Let us then try Juce from its basics.</p>
<p>I looked online and have found a pretty fresh full course on freeCodeCamp (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Iq4_Kd7Rc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Iq4_Kd7Rc</a>) by Chuck from MatKat Music. His tutorial is mostly for Mac users, but if you are familiar with Linux and knows how to handle Makefiles to compile your code, you&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>

<p>In this course you&rsquo;ll learn not Modern C++, but how to create audio processors with Juce, and it is pretty tough, I must say. Advanced stuff going on all the time.</p>
<p>We have built a cool Simple Equalizer plugin that can run on any DAW or maybe a dedicated device (would I try it on a Raspberry Pi some day?), and Chuck also gives a brief overlook on his personal courses. I am convinced of taking his lessons in a near future. Check at <a href="https://www.programmingformusicians.com/pfmcpp/">https://www.programmingformusicians.com/pfmcpp/</a>.</p>
<p>There is a snapshot of me running SimpleEq on our beloved Reaper.

<p>Cool stuff. I will start trying to build a delay effect on Monday. Let us see. Gazers have to gaze.</p>
<p>Bye then folks!</p>
