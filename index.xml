      <description>Hi there and welcome! This is Alex here. I am starting this personal/semi-professional blog on GitHub. Let us then launch this space with a banger! Today I would like to present you a project I have been working hard these past couple of months. OpenQVision is a Open Source project that allows Computer Vision to become more readable by non-programmer users, or even helps data scientists to check their neural network models on the fly.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Hi there and welcome! This is Alex here. I am starting this personal/semi-professional blog on GitHub. Let us then launch this space with a banger! Today I would like to present you a project I have been working hard these past couple of months. OpenQVision is a Open Source project that allows Computer Vision to become more readable by non-programmer users, or even helps data scientists to check their neural network models on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dev-gazer.github.io/OpenQVision-MainWindow.png&#34; alt=&#34;OpenQVision Main Window&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, OpenQVision works with camera streaming, and you&amp;rsquo;ll need to set as input the path for your model files, i.e. weights, configuration and class names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also possible to integrate it with external actions. The version uploaded triggers a Telegram Bot that send a capture after the detection runs for some user-defined amount of frames. Let us say, if a guitar is seen on the screen for more than 10 consecutive frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dev-gazer.github.io/telegram-bot-example.png&#34; alt=&#34;Telegram Bot Example&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All right, before I forget, OpenQVision is written in C++. It is actually a port from its previous version, which was in Python language. For the sake of performance, I have managed to learn OpenCV in C++ and review my previous knowledge on Qt applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More details, access OpenQVision official repository &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dev-gazer/OpenQVision,&#34;&gt;https://github.com/dev-gazer/OpenQVision,&lt;/a&gt; message me on Twitter at @dev_gazer, find me on LinkedIn at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandremfaria/&#34;&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandremfaria/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Hi all This is Alex here, you can find me in twitter as @dev_gazer. I will start posting to this blog hosted in GitHub as a guide to my repositories and online projects.
You can expect from me regular uploads and maintenance.
I usually code in Python but you can expect some content in other languages such as php, C++, and in various subjects such as Computer Vision, DevOps, Database Integration, Cloud Computing, automation and so on!</description>
